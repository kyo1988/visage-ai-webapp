### Abstract

This executive preview presents specification-compliant validation of Ehrenberg-Bass marketing science principles using publicly available datasets. Through rigorous statistical analysis of Instacart, dunnhumby, and UCI data, we test theoretical predictions against real-world evidence and reveal important insights about market dynamics.

**Key Findings:**
- DoP near-miss (0.015863) - closest to specification-compliant PASS
- Q4 heavy buyers show strongest relationship (RÂ²=0.472)
- DJ analysis fails correlation threshold (r=0.627 vs 0.80 target)
- CEP analysis reveals English-centric bias (r=-0.28)
