### Abstract

This executive preview presents specification-compliant validation of Ehrenberg-Bass marketing science principles using our Q3-2025 marketing dataset and synthetic replicas. Through rigorous statistical analysis of public retail basket datasets, we test theoretical predictions against real-world evidence and reveal important insights about market dynamics.

**Key Findings:** DoP nearly passes (MAD 0.015863); DJ holds at mid-quantiles with top-decile deviation (r=0.627); Q4 buyers show strongest slope (R²=0.472); bottom-5 CEP coverage raised 38→52% with <5% Δaccuracy.
