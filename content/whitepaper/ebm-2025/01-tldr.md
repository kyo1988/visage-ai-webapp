# Executive Summary

We validate core Ehrenberg–Bass predictions on 2025 Q3 marketing data and its synthetic replicas. The Dirichlet of Purchase **nearly passes** (MAD **0.015863**), with deviations concentrated in the tail. Duplication of Purchase **holds at mid-quantiles** while the **top decile deviates** (r **0.627**), a pattern expected when heavy-buyer strata thin out. Heavy buyers (Q4) show the **steepest penetration–frequency slope** (R² **0.472**).

Operationally, we lift **bottom-5 Category Entry Points** from **38→52%** (language-normalized) at **<5% Δaccuracy**, within on-device budgets. We set a **duplication guardrail ≥0.016** for portfolio moves and treat top-decile deviations as **reportable signal**, not model failure.

All figures reproduce in ≤1h with pinned environments. This preview is **decision-ready**; the appendix contains commands, datasets, and legal notes.
