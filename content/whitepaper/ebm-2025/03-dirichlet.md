# Dirichlet Analysis

Our analysis of the NBD-Dirichlet model using UCI bodycare transaction data (900K+ records across 1,264 active buyers and 27 distinct brands) reveals significant challenges in fitting real-world purchase patterns. The model demonstrates poor statistical fit with an RÂ² of approximately -7e-06, indicating substantial deviation from theoretical predictions.

**Implications**: The poor model fit highlights the importance of treating theoretical predictions as guidelines rather than absolute rules, emphasizing the need for empirical validation and adaptive modeling approaches in marketing science applications.
