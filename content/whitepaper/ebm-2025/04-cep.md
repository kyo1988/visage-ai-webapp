# CEP Analysis

Our comprehensive analysis of Category Entry Points across 27 languages using Amazon Beauty Reviews (2018) reveals significant language bias in brand coverage assessment. The analysis processed 256 language-specific matches through sentence-level hit rate calculations using our curated lexicon (v1.0), with language detection, embedding, and taxonomy processing.

**Implications**: The significant language bias in CEP analysis underscores the need for language normalization in multilingual marketing strategies, ensuring that brand coverage assessments are culturally appropriate and linguistically fair across different markets.
