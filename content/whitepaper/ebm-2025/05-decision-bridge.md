# Decision Bridge: What We Do This Quarter

Based on our comprehensive analysis of Ehrenberg-Bass principles using public datasets, we have identified specific actionable strategies for implementing evidence-based marketing approaches. Our research findings provide clear guidance on how to optimize marketing efforts while maintaining statistical rigor and practical applicability.

The key insights from our analysis point to three critical areas of focus: raising Category Entry Point coverage for bottom-performing brands, maintaining accuracy thresholds while optimizing performance, and establishing appropriate guardrails for portfolio management decisions. These strategies are grounded in empirical evidence and designed to address the real-world challenges identified in our statistical analysis.
